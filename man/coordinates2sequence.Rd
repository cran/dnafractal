\title{Generates a DNA Sequence Based on an X and Y Coordinate over several iterations}
\arguments{
\item{xstart}{the starting x coordinate in the fractal image}

\item{ystart}{the starting y coordinate in the fractal image}

\item{n}{the number of bases to be calculated in the DNA sequence}
}
\value{
The DNA sequence
}
\description{
The function takes an X and Y coordinate and a number of bases to be represented in the DNA sequence.
The function starts at the provided X and Y coordinates and then works backward, calculating every preceding base
in the DNA sequence that led to that particular point in the fractal. Based on the actual X, Y point's coordinate,
the base pair corresponding to that coordinate is inferred, and the DNA string will be built up and returned as the
product of the function.
